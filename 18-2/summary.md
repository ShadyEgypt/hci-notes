## 💡 Segment 1 _(from minute 1 to minute 3)_

### Discussion  
Eleonora Ceccaldi introduces the research centre and international projects at the University of Genoa, inviting participants to explore recorded seminars and use shared links and QR codes. She previews upcoming seminars related to modeling and introduces guest professor Bianca Ricciardian Kardi from a Paris-based research centre. Professor Ceccaldi explains her roles in digital humanities and other interdisciplinary areas and hands the session over for a practical workshop on UI and UX.

## 💡 Segment 2 _(from minute 3 to minute 5)_

### Discussion  
Professor Bianca introduces herself, sharing her academic background and research in human-computer interaction, social robots, virtual agents, and immersive environments. Her work focuses on analyzing nonverbal behaviors in human-machine interaction. She highlights a dual approach: studying user behavior to improve systems and using those systems to understand users better.

---

## 💡 Segment 3 _(from minute 5 to minute 7)_

### Discussion  
Bianca details her lab in Paris, "Inact", housed within a network of engineering schools across France. The lab blends psychology, ergonomics, and engineering research, focusing on applications in industry, building, and education. She introduces the day’s activity: a hands-on design workshop aimed at exploring and applying design principles, which will continue with prototyping exercises the following day.

## 💡 Segment 4 _(from minute 7 to minute 9)_

### Discussion  
Professor Bianca explains the structure of the session. She will introduce her research in more detail tomorrow, and today’s focus is a hands-on activity. The group is asked to complete a task on a website called *userinyourface.com*, which simulates a poorly designed interface. The purpose is to experience frustrating design firsthand. After the task, they will debrief and relate the experience to key design principles. Participants are encouraged to work in pairs or small groups, especially if not everyone has a computer.

---

## 💡 Segment 5 _(from minute 9 to minute 11)_

### Discussion  
Participants are guided on how to proceed with the activity. Bianca encourages those without laptops to try on their smartphones or collaborate with others nearby. She checks if everyone has access to the site and gives the go-ahead to begin the exercise. The goal is to see who can complete the frustrating interface task first.

---

## 💡 Segment 24 _(from minute 47 to minute 49)_

### Discussion  
The lecturer reflects on user expectations and design principles, using an example where a red message wasn’t an error — highlighting how users instinctively associate color with meaning. She elaborates on poor UI choices, like sliders for continuous input that don’t show values in real time. One issue raised was using a birth year slider that included unrealistic ranges (like people born in 1900s). The discussion continues with identifying and naming common UX problems encountered in the exercise.


## 💡 Segment 25 _(from minute 49 to minute 51)_

### Discussion  
Participants share further issues found in the bad UI. These include confusing default selections, non-intuitive feedback messages, and difficulty identifying elements like image uploads. The lecturer reinforces that while the exercise is amusing as a game, such UX problems can cause serious frustration in real-world contexts like booking tickets. She emphasizes the value of patience and awareness when analyzing such flawed interfaces.

---

## 💡 Segment 26 _(from minute 51 to minute 53)_

### Discussion  
More specific usability issues are discussed, including black-and-white flags that can’t be easily distinguished, slow interface performance, and counterintuitive placements (e.g., a “close” button in an unexpected area). The lecturer acknowledges the abundance of issues on every page and begins to steer the session toward wrapping up group findings to transition into formal UX principles.

---

## 💡 Segment 27 _(from minute 53 to minute 55)_

### Discussion  
The lecturer transitions from discussion to instruction. She introduces the concept of affordances and explains that many common usability principles exist under various names. Referring to design frameworks (like Nielsen’s heuristics), she outlines the goal: categorize the issues encountered and understand the core principles behind them. She begins this with an example — a button that looks clickable but does nothing — highlighting the importance of intuitive design cues.

## 💡 Segment 28 _(from minute 55 to minute 57)_

### Discussion  
The lecturer continues discussing key UI/UX principles, emphasizing that dangerous actions like deleting user data should always require confirmation. Confirmation prompts must be clear and unambiguous to help prevent irreversible mistakes. Even if the user truly intends the action, the system should verify intent to reduce errors.

---

## 💡 Segment 29 _(from minute 57 to minute 59)_

### Discussion  
She introduces the idea that users should never be blamed for errors. Instead, systems should explain the error clearly and offer a path to recovery. She highlights the importance of supporting reversible actions (e.g., Ctrl+Z) and avoiding vague error codes (e.g., "404") by using clear language that helps users understand what went wrong.

---

## 💡 Segment 30 _(from minute 59 to minute 61)_

### Discussion  
The lecturer explains that UI design must account for human cognitive and attentional limits. Designers should know these psychological traits and build interfaces that respect them. She points out that in one form, users were asked to select a gender — but it was not clear which option was selected, illustrating poor visibility and interaction feedback.

---

## 💡 Segment 31 _(from minute 61 to minute 63)_

### Discussion  
A discussion follows on visual indicators for selections. Students mention that default selections were unclear. The lecturer proposes possible fixes: using distinct visual styles (not just color) to indicate selection or having no default option so users are required to choose. She categorizes the issue under **visibility**, stressing the importance of understanding system status at a glance.

---

## 💡 Segment 32 _(from minute 63 to minute 65)_

### Discussion  
The lecturer expands the idea of **visibility** beyond specific examples. She stresses that systems should be easy to use without needing to read instructions. Immediate feedback is also crucial — users must know if their actions were successful. The group also discusses frustrations with the final website task, such as selecting all items manually and the failure of familiar shortcuts like Ctrl+A.

---

## 💡 Segment 33 _(from minute 65 to minute 67)_

### Discussion  
She explains the significance of **shortcuts** in design. Expert users rely on them to be more efficient, while novice users may ignore them. A good system should support both types. She emphasizes designing for various levels of user expertise. She also shares a joke about mistaken flag identities during the activity to illustrate user expectations in interface elements.

---

## 💡 Segment 34 _(from minute 67 to minute 69)_

### Discussion  
The discussion turns to **cognitive load**. Sliders that require precision or unnecessary searching (e.g., for a flag) increase the user's mental burden. She advises using design patterns that minimize short-term memory load. For example, the "three-click rule" suggests users should be able to find what they need within three clicks — while not a strict rule, it’s a useful design guideline to reduce user frustration.

---

## 💡 Segment 35 _(from minute 69 to minute 71)_

### Discussion  
The lecturer further explores **recognition vs. recall**. Recognizing something from options (e.g., multiple choice) is cognitively easier than recalling it from scratch. Applied to interface design, this means displaying available commands (e.g., menus) is better for novice users. Expert users may still benefit from typing commands directly, but interfaces should prioritize easing memory load.

---

## 💡 Segment 36 _(from minute 71 to minute 73)_

### Discussion  
She reinforces the importance of designing for human limitations. Clear feedback, visible options, and informative error messages all contribute to better UX. She wraps up this section by noting how cognitive science principles — like attention span and working memory — should influence how interfaces are built and evaluated.

---

## 💡 Segment 37 _(from minute 73 to minute 75)_

### Discussion  
The lecturer shares one last example: a confusing gender selection design where users couldn’t tell which option was selected. This leads to a discussion of **visibility** — users must be able to understand what state the system is in without guessing. Solutions include changing styles or avoiding preselected options. Visibility is again emphasized as a core principle in interface clarity.

---

## 💡 Segment 38 _(from minute 75 to minute 77)_

### Discussion  
She summarizes visibility in terms of feedback: users must understand the current state and the result of their actions. Frustration grew when expected feedback (like selection acknowledgment) was missing. Shortcuts not working also added to this. She reiterates that expert users expect speed and support for known actions like keyboard shortcuts — lack of this is a major UX flaw.

---

## 💡 Segment 39 _(from minute 77 to minute 79)_

### Discussion  
The concept of **flexibility and efficiency of use** is explained. Interfaces should adapt to user experience levels, allowing shortcuts for experts while keeping clarity for novices. She highlights the importance of personalization in design — some users may need more guidance, while others want to speed up tasks. An inclusive design anticipates this range.

---

## 💡 Segment 40 _(from minute 79 to minute 81)_

### Discussion  
Cognitive overload remains the focus. Precision sliders and complex UI tasks increase frustration. She discusses the “three-click rule” again, emphasizing that too many steps drain user attention. Interfaces should be intuitive and fast to navigate, or users may abandon them entirely. Minimizing clicks and maximizing clarity improves usability.

---

## 💡 Segment 41 _(from minute 81 to minute 83)_

### Discussion  
The lecturer explains the difference between **recognition** and **recall** again using a quiz analogy. If users can recognize answers from options, cognitive effort is lower. In UI terms, showing menu options supports recognition. She concludes this section by encouraging students to review the referenced researchers and principles on their own.

---

## 💡 Segment 42 _(from minute 83 to minute 85)_

### Discussion  
She introduces the difference between **conceptual models** (how the system is built) and **mental models** (what users expect). A mismatch between these leads to poor UX. The “userinyourface” site is an example of this — it violated all expectations users had about interface behavior. She advocates for **user-centered design**, where the user is part of the design process from the beginning.

---

## 💡 Segment 43 _(from minute 85 to minute 87)_

### Discussion  
User-centered design should involve users throughout development, not just at the end. She also introduces the concept of **metaphors** in design, like the desktop metaphor in operating systems. Using real-world analogies (folders, trash) helps users quickly understand digital systems because the interaction mirrors familiar actions.

---

## 💡 Segment 44 _(from minute 87 to minute 89)_

### Discussion  
She expands on metaphors. Swiping to turn pages in an ebook mimics flipping a real book. Box-based storage metaphors (e.g., Dropbox) and natural language interfaces are other examples. Metaphors help bridge the mental gap between user understanding and system complexity. She then introduces a simple model to conceptualize interaction using objects and user actions.

---

## 💡 Segment 45 _(from minute 89 to minute 91)_

### Discussion  
The lecturer describes a five-step interaction framework:  
1. **Objects** – what the user manipulates  
2. **Operations** – what the user can do to those objects  
3. **Commands** – how users execute operations  
4. **Feedback** – system response during the operation  
5. **Response** – final confirmation of the completed action  

This model is useful in both design and programming, especially for object-oriented thinking.

---

## 💡 Segment 46 _(from minute 91 to minute 93)_

### Discussion  
She explains the difference between **feedback** (during action) and **response** (after action). For example, dragging an item to the trash gives feedback; the deletion is the response. Systems should avoid making irreversible actions too easy. She summarizes that well-designed interfaces prioritize user needs and follow design rules to enhance usability and reduce frustration.

---

## 💡 Segment 47 _(from minute 93 to minute 95)_

### Discussion  
She introduces two key evaluation concepts: **usability** and **user experience (UX)**. While related, they are not the same. Usability focuses on effectiveness and efficiency; UX includes emotions and satisfaction. Tomorrow’s session will cover how to measure both, using real user input to evaluate systems. She invites students to reflect and ask questions.

---

## 💡 Segment 48 _(from minute 95 to minute 97)_

### Discussion  
The session concludes with appreciation for the speaker and reminders about upcoming seminars, including one scheduled for Thursday morning at 9:40. Attendance is encouraged, though not mandatory. The wrap-up confirms the relevance of the topics to broader fields such as digital humanities and computer interaction.
