## üßë‚Äçüíª What is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)? _(from minute 14 to minute 15)_

### ACM Definition of HCI
> ‚ÄúHCI is a discipline concerned with the **design, evaluation, and implementation** of interactive computing systems for human use, and with the **study of major phenomena** surrounding them.‚Äù

### Role in Academia & Industry
- ACM and IEEE **define university curricula** for HCI based on **industry needs**.
- Aim to align education with practical, job-ready **skills and knowledge**.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Evolution of Interfaces

### Beyond Traditional PCs
- HCI today includes:
  - **Smartphones**
  - **Smartwatches & wearables**
  - **Virtual and Mixed Reality**
  - **Embodied interfaces** (body, voice, gestures)

### Key Concept: Active Machines
- Unlike passive tools (e.g., a chair or hammer), **active machines** interact with humans dynamically.
- HCI focuses on:
  - How users interact with machines that **respond or adapt**.
  - Designing machines to become **extensions of the human body/mind**.

---

## üß† Human Factors & Ergonomics

### Physical Ergonomics
- Example: A chair must be designed to support the **human body's posture**.
- Tables should be at proper height for writing and comfort.

### Cognitive Ergonomics
- Interface design must:
  - Be **intuitive** and easy to learn.
  - Minimize cognitive load (e.g., reduce the need to memorize or read manuals).
  - Support **efficient memory use and task performance**.

---

## üß¨ Course Direction: Studying the Human First

### Before Designing Interfaces
- We must study:
  - **Human physical characteristics**
  - **Cognitive abilities**
  - **Emotional behaviors**
- This understanding is foundational to:
  - Creating effective interfaces.
  - Designing robots or systems that interact with humans naturally.

---

## üìù Key Takeaways
- HCI is about more than technology‚Äîit's about understanding **how people use and experience technology**.
- Good interface design requires **human-centered thinking**, both physically and cognitively.
- The first part of the course will focus on **understanding the human user**, as a prerequisite for effective design.

## ü§ñ Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) _(from minute 15 to minute 16)_

### Key Challenges
- Robots often trigger initial **fear, skepticism, or discomfort** in users.
- Goal: Design robot behavior to make interactions **trustworthy and reassuring**.
  - Especially relevant in contexts like:
    - **Elderly assistance**
    - **Rehabilitation programs**

### Foundations from HCI
- Principles learned in this course apply directly to **Human-Robot Interaction**.
- Core HCI knowledge is essential before exploring advanced topics in robotics.

## üß† AI in Interface Design

### Embedding AI in Interfaces
- Developers might embed tools like **ChatGPT** in software interfaces.
  - Examples:
    - Task assistance tools
    - Healthcare applications (e.g., AI helping clinicians choose treatments)

### Key Considerations
- AI must be integrated **responsibly** to avoid harming users.
- Understand the potential for **bias** and **trust issues**.
  - Case study:
    - An AI tool performed well for **male patients aged 20‚Äì50**.
    - The same tool had **high error rates for female patients**.

### Design Implications
- Designers must ensure:
  - AI does **not mislead or bias** users.
  - Interfaces **communicate limitations** of the AI clearly.
  - Human oversight is built into AI-driven tools.
