## ❓ Possible Exam Questions & Answers _(from minute 5 to minute 7)_

> **Q1: How has the course format changed and why?**
- A: Due to an increase in student numbers, the startup simulation format was replaced by standard lectures.

> **Q2: What is the format of the exam?**
- A: Oral, involving discussion of concrete design problems and demonstrating understanding of design principles.

> **Q3: Why shouldn't you say an interface is "user-friendly" in an exam?**
- A: It's too vague. Use evaluation methods to assess usability and interaction instead.

> **Q4: What does ACM stand for and why is it relevant?**
- A: The Association for Computing Machinery. It defines core computing standards and is key for your future career.

> **Q5: How do you evaluate the quality of an interface?**
- A: Apply design methodologies and usability testing to assess effectiveness and user interaction.

## 🌍 Professional Development & Lifelong Learning _(from minute 10 to minute 11)_

### Importance of ACM and IEEE
- **ACM**: Association for Computing Machinery (non-profit, international).
- **IEEE**: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which includes the **IEEE Computer Society**.
- Both are leading organizations in computer science and **critical reference points for your career**.

### Staying Updated
- The field evolves quickly (e.g., AI, machine learning, ChatGPT, deep learning).
- To remain competitive:
  - **Keep learning continuously** even after your degree.
  - Follow **reliable sources** and professional journals (ACM/IEEE).
  - Avoid relying solely on non-expert media (e.g., newspapers or unverified magazines).

### Suggested Resources
- **Coursera**: For learning new skills like AI or machine learning.
  - Search for introductory courses.
  - Study during flexible periods like summer.
- **YouTube & Online Courses**: Can supplement formal learning if chosen wisely.

### Key Advice from the Professor
- **Be proactive** in managing your education.
- Continuously acquire knowledge that aligns with your **professional goals**.
- Choose sources based on **technical accuracy**, not just popularity or trends.

## 📈 Lifelong Learning & Career Sustainability _(from minute 11 to minute 12)_

### Role of ACM and IEEE Continued
- Major tech companies (**Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple**, etc.) are involved in these associations.
- These bodies are central to **continuous professional education** in tech fields.

### Why Lifelong Learning Matters
- **Job markets evolve quickly**—your current skills may be outdated in 5 years if you stop learning.
- Real-world example: A brilliant student who stopped learning ended up in a non-technical support role.

### Risks of Stagnation
- Tech companies may restructure and relocate, causing job losses.
- If you stop investing in learning:
  - You risk being replaced by newer graduates.
  - Your salary expectations won’t match your outdated skillset.

## 🌐 Professional Resources & Conferences _(from minute 12 to minute 14)_

### ACM & IEEE Activities
- These associations offer:
  - **International conferences**
  - **Tutorials and workshops**
  - **Online and in-person courses**
  - **Printed and online journals/transactions**

### Journals vs. Transactions
- Both are types of professional publications.
- Often differ in scope and formatting but are both **peer-reviewed and academically respected**.

### ACM Special Interest Groups (SIGs)
- Example: **ACM SIGCHI** (Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction)
  - Organizes the most important annual HCI conference: **CHI**

### Attending CHI Conference – Career Tip
- In job interviews, you may not be able to negotiate salary, but you can ask for:
  - **Conference funding**
  - **Professional development support**
